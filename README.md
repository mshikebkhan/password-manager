This is a simple but very useful password manager GUI app build with Python Tkinter.
Here you can store your passwords for your username/emails.
It also suggest you strong passwords and automatically copy them on clip board.
It has search functionality to search passwords for your accounts from your stored data.
It stores data in json file

(This Password Manager is not password protected and Json file can be directly accessed by intruders too so in further updates I will make it 
password protected and will add encryption in Json file. You are welcome if you want to modify it:)
